## Introdution
### Business question
Dataset has two sample datasets attached to this test:
- prices.csv: records of product's history price changes in Sep 2018
- sales.csv records of product's sales in Sep 2018
Use any data wrangling tools to calculcate the total revenue of each product at each price. The solution must be applicable to similar datasets with large numbers of records.
